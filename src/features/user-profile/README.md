# Feature: User Profile Management (`/src/features/user-profile`)

This feature module is intended for more advanced user profile management beyond the basic display name and email provided by the authentication system.

## Purpose

- Allow users to manage more detailed profile information.
- Provide options for customizing their application experience related to their profile.
- Potentially handle avatar uploads or links to external profile information.

## Planned Components/Services (Placeholders)

- **`/components`**:
  - `AvatarUploader.tsx`: A component to handle user avatar image uploads (would likely require backend storage).
  - `ProfileForm.tsx`: A form for users to edit extended profile details (e.g., full name, preferred currency - if multi-currency is implemented, notification preferences - if advanced notifications are implemented).
  - `AccountSecuritySettings.tsx`: Components related to account security, such as changing passwords (if not handled by Firebase UI directly) or managing two-factor authentication (highly advanced).
- **`/app/(app)/profile/page.tsx`** (Placeholder): A dedicated page for users to view and manage their profile. This would be distinct from the general `/settings` page.

## Integration

- This feature would integrate closely with the `AuthContext` for current user data.
- Profile data beyond what Firebase Auth stores (like custom preferences) would need to be managed, potentially in `localStorage` or a dedicated backend service if the app scales.

This module allows for future expansion of user-specific settings and personalization within Trackwise.
