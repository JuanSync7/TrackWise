# Feature: Advanced Reports (`/src/features/advanced-reports`)

This feature module will house components, services, and logic related to more advanced financial reporting and data visualization for the Trackwise application.

## Purpose

The goal is to provide users with deeper insights into their financial data beyond the basic reports currently available. This could include:

- Detailed breakdowns of spending by category over custom time periods.
- Trend analysis for income vs. expenses.
- Net worth tracking and visualization over time.
- Cash flow analysis and projections.
- Customizable report generation.

## Planned Components/Services (Placeholders)

- **`/components`**:
  - `CategoryDeepDiveChart.tsx`: A component for detailed visualization of spending within a specific category or subcategories.
  - `NetWorthTracker.tsx`: A component to input assets/liabilities and visualize net worth trends.
  - `ReportCustomizerForm.tsx`: A form to allow users to define parameters for custom reports.
- **`/services`**:
  - `report-data-service.ts`: Functions to process and aggregate financial data for various advanced report types.
- **`/utils`**:
  - Helper functions specific to report generation or data transformation for reports.

This feature will likely interact heavily with the data provided by the `PersonalFinanceContext`, `HouseholdContext`, and `TripContext`.
