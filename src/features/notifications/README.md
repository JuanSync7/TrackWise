# Feature: Notifications & Reminders (`/src/features/notifications`)

This feature module will handle the logic for generating and displaying notifications or reminders to the user within the Trackwise application.

## Purpose

- Alert users about important financial events or upcoming deadlines.
- Provide timely reminders for bill payments or recurring transactions.
- Notify users when they are approaching or exceeding budget limits.

## Planned Components/Services (Placeholders)

- **`/services`**:
  - `notification-service.ts`: A service to manage the creation, scheduling (if client-side scheduling is used), and display of notifications. This might integrate with browser Notification API or an in-app notification system.
- **`/workers`** (Optional, for more advanced background tasks):
  - `reminder-worker.ts`: If using Web Workers or Service Workers for background checks (e.g., checking for due recurring transactions even when the app tab is not active), this would house that logic. This is significantly more complex and might be out of scope for a purely client-side app without a backend.
- **`/components`**:
  - `NotificationBell.tsx`: A UI component (perhaps in the app header) to indicate new notifications.
  - `NotificationList.tsx`: A component to display a list of past notifications.

## Types of Notifications/Reminders

- Upcoming recurring transaction due.
- Bill payment reminders (if bills are tracked as a separate entity or as recurring expenses with due dates).
- Budget limit warnings (e.g., "You've spent 80% of your 'Food' budget this month").
- Financial goal deadlines approaching.
- Debt payment due dates.

Implementation might start with simple in-app alerts using the existing `useToast` system for less critical notifications, and potentially expand to browser notifications for more time-sensitive reminders.
