# Feature: Data Sync & Import/Export (`/src/features/data-sync`)

This feature module will focus on functionalities related to data synchronization, importing data from external sources, and exporting application data in various formats.

## Purpose

- Allow users to import existing financial data (e.g., from bank statements or other apps via CSV).
- Provide more robust export options beyond the current basic CSV exports.
- Potentially explore synchronization with cloud storage or third-party financial aggregators (e.g., Plaid - though this would significantly increase complexity and require a backend).

## Planned Components/Services (Placeholders)

- **`/components`**:
  - `ImportCsvForm.tsx`: A form component to allow users to upload CSV files and map columns to transaction fields.
  - `ExportSettingsForm.tsx`: A component to configure advanced export options (e.g., date ranges, specific accounts/categories, different formats like JSON).
  - `SyncStatusIndicator.tsx`: A UI element to show the status of any ongoing data synchronization.
- **`/services`**:
  - `import-parser-service.ts`: Logic for parsing uploaded CSV files, handling different date formats, and mapping data to the application's transaction structure.
  - `export-generator-service.ts`: Functions to generate export files in various formats based on user selections.
  - `plaid-link-service.ts` (Hypothetical): Service to manage Plaid Link integration for bank account synchronization.

This feature aims to make Trackwise more flexible and interoperable with users' existing financial data workflows.
