# Features (`/src/features`)

This directory is intended to house modules or collections of components, services, and types that constitute larger, distinct features which might be developed or added to the Trackwise application in the future.

Organizing by feature can help in managing complexity as the application grows, allowing developers to focus on a specific domain of functionality.

## Current Planned/Potential Feature Areas (Placeholders)

The subdirectories currently present are placeholders for potential future development:

- **`/advanced-reports`**:
  - For more sophisticated reporting and data visualization beyond the current basic reports.
  - Could include deeper category analysis, net worth tracking, cash flow projections, etc.

- **`/data-sync`**:
  - To implement features related to data import/export or synchronization with external services.
  - Examples: Importing transactions from CSV, Plaid integration (if applicable).

- **`/multi-currency`**:
  - For adding support for handling transactions and accounts in multiple currencies.
  - Would involve currency conversion utilities, user preferences for default currency, etc.

- **`/notifications`**:
  - To manage and deliver notifications or reminders to users (e.g., upcoming bill payments, budget alerts).

- **`/user-profile`**:
  - For extended user profile management beyond basic authentication details.
  - Could include avatar uploads, more detailed personal information, or account preferences not covered in general settings.

## Structure within a Feature Directory

A typical feature directory (e.g., `/src/features/advanced-reports`) might contain:

- **`/components`**: React components specific to this feature.
- **`/contexts`**: React Contexts if the feature has its own complex state.
- **`/hooks`**: Custom React hooks used within the feature.
- **`/services`**: Service functions for business logic, data fetching, or transformations related to the feature.
- **`/types`**: TypeScript type definitions specific to the feature.
- **`README.md`**: A description of the feature, its purpose, and how its modules are organized.

This structure is a guideline and can be adapted based on the complexity and needs of each feature.
